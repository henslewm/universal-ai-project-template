"""The one Ctrl+C policy for every scripts/*.py command line (ADR-072; README "CLI exit codes").

A CLI returns 0 for success, 1 for a handled refusal and 2 for a not-OK outcome itself; this
module adds only what is shared: an interrupt returns 130 without a traceback, whether it
arrives while the CLI is still loading or once it runs, and the few steps an interrupt must not
cut in half hold it until they finish.

A CLI imports this module before anything else, so at module level it imports only `sys`, which
the interpreter always has loaded (even under `python -S`): loading it opens no window in which
an interrupt could escape before `guard_startup` is installed. Everything else is imported
where it is used.
